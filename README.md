# Guiitamp [BETA]

Guiitamp is an Android application that takes an electric guitar sound in input, elaborates it with audio effects (optional), and sends out the manipulated output. It is based on [Android OBOE](https://github.com/google/oboe) framework, in order to obtain the lowest latency possible. The audio effects are taken from the [STK library](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/). 

Before using the app you need a guitar interface adapter, some examples are the [IK Multimedia - iRig 2](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irig2/) or an [audio card](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B01N905VOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3414&creative=21718&creativeASIN=B01N905VOY&linkCode=as2&tag=nachos07-21&linkId=428852c84811c06db53174f7fea5cebe) via OTG. Then, in app, you can select the input and output interfaces.

The idea of this app was born from my latest hobby (guitar obiviously) and from [Android OBOE example](https://github.com/google/oboe/tree/main/samples/LiveEffect) found after some other online researches. There are some similar apps on the Play Store but with older devices have too much latency.
